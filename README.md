# 4k Intro Template

Template code for building a 4k demoscene intro on Windows.
The template is based on [Inigo Guilez's 4k framework](http://www.iquilezles.org/code/isystem1k4k/isystem1k4k.htm).
Rendering is done in GLSL shaders.

The template ships with Crinkler 2.0 and Shader Minifier 1.0.
The minifier is automatically run for the fragment and post processing shaders during compilation.
